                        <h2>My name is John and living the simple life saved my life</h2>
                        <p>I used to be a pack rat. I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even
                            appreciate
                            any of it because there was too much.</p>
                        <p>Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a
                            relationship.</p>
                        <h3>How I turned things around</h3>
                        <p>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything. I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage,
                            sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.
                            It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it
                            worked.</p>
                        <h3>Now I live the simple life</h3>
                        <p>Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have
                            more free time to enjoy.</p>
                        <p>With how much it turned my life around, I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it, and how others
                            can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!</p>
